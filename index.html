        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. SDK Usage Information</h2>
    <p>Hakka Calculator uses the following SDKs to provide functionality, improve user experience, and ensure optimal performance:</p>

    <h3>1. AndroidX SDK</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> AndroidX is a set of libraries that are used to provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework components.</p>
    <p><strong>Why We Use It:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To ensure a consistent and modern user experience by providing updated UI components like <code>ConstraintLayout</code> and <code>CardView</code>.</li>
        <li>To enhance compatibility across various devices by using standardized components that are actively maintained and updated.</li>
        <li>It provides essential libraries like <code>AppCompatActivity</code> to maintain the compatibility of modern UI elements across different Android devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Material Components SDK</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Material Components for Android provide the foundation for implementing Material Design, Google's design system that supports modern and beautiful UI.</p>
    <p><strong>Why We Use It:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create a visually appealing interface that is user-friendly and consistent with contemporary app design standards.</li>
        <li>Material components like <code>Button</code>, <code>CardView</code>, and <code>TextView</code> enhance the app’s look and feel, making it more interactive and engaging for the user.</li>
        <li>These components help in maintaining a consistent design language throughout the app, providing a cohesive user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Kotlin SDK</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Kotlin is a modern programming language that simplifies Android app development with enhanced syntax, safety features, and interoperability with Java.</p>
    <p><strong>Why We Use It:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kotlin allows us to write safer, more concise code with fewer chances of errors, enhancing the overall performance of the app.</li>
        <li>The language’s null safety features significantly reduce common programming errors, making the app more stable and less prone to crashes.</li>
        <li>It integrates seamlessly with existing Java libraries, enabling the use of robust mathematical libraries for calculations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Java Math Library (BigInteger)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Java Math library provides <code>BigInteger</code>, a class designed to handle calculations involving large numbers that exceed the capacity of primitive data types.</p>
    <p><strong>Why We Use It:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used specifically for performing operations like factorial calculations of large numbers to avoid overflow issues that can occur with standard data types like <code>Int</code> or <code>Long</code>.</li>
        <li>Ensures accurate results for advanced mathematical computations, making the app capable of handling complex calculations without performance degradation.</li>
    </ul>
